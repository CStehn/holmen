\title{Function for DESeq2 differential expression analysis workflow}
\usage{
run_deseq(counts, samples, design = ~trt, human = TRUE,
  filt_threshold = 1, top = 40, blind = TRUE, font_size = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{a tibble with each row representing counts from a gene of interest, the 1st column being the gene names, and each column representing a sample}

\item{samples}{a tibble with each row representing samples in the counts tibble with variables of interest included}

\item{design}{a formula specifying the variables of interest to be included in the analysis in the form ~ v1 + v2 + ... + vn. Defaults to ~ trt}

\item{human}{a logical value specifying whether to use a human annotation table. Defaults to TRUE. FALSE defaults to mouse}

\item{filt_threshold}{value specifying the minimum amount of counts needed by a sample within a gene to pass to DESeq}

\item{top}{either an integer specifying the number of top ranked genes (by p-value) to create heatmap, or a character vector of specific genes of interest}

\item{blind}{a logical value specifying whether the rlog or vst transformations are blind to experimental design. Defaults to TRUE}

\item{font_size}{integer specifying the font size for rows of the heatmap}
}
\value{
Returns PCA for each variable along with results table, volcano, heatmap, and sample correlation heatmap using the top genes between each comparison
}
\description{
This function will output results and plots for each comparison within each variable presented in the samples table

\examples{
\dontrun{
run_deseq(counts, samples, design = ~ gender + height, human = TRUE, filt_threshold = 10, top = 200, blind = TRUE, font_size = 3)
