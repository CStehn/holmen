Description: An implementation common lab computational workflows for the Sheri Holmen Lab at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. For example, this package contains a wrapper function for the entirety of the DESeq2 workflow for differential expression analysis for RNA-Seq in R. This package utilizes pre-developed wrapper functions for multiple DESeq2 commands from hciR, developed by Chris Stubben.
